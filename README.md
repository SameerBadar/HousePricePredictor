# HousePricePredictor
Project Overview:

The House Pricing Predictor is a machine learning project designed to estimate house prices based on various features using linear regression. The project involves a comprehensive approach from data cleaning to model evaluation, aimed at creating a reliable tool for predicting house values.

Data Cleaning and Preparation:

The initial phase focused on data cleaning. A dataset containing key features such as location, size, and number of bedrooms was collected. This data was preprocessed to handle missing values, correct data types, and standardize formats. Essential steps included normalizing numerical features and encoding categorical variables to prepare the data for analysis.

Feature engineering was also conducted to improve the dataset. New features were created, and existing ones were transformed to enhance the model’s performance. This step was crucial for ensuring the dataset’s quality and the accuracy of the predictions.

Predictive Modeling:

The core of the project was applying linear regression to model the relationship between house prices (dependent variable) and various features (independent variables). The dataset was divided into training and testing sets. The model was trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set to assess its ability to generalize to new data.

Evaluation metrics used included Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. MAE and MSE measured the model’s error magnitude, while R-squared indicated how well the model explained the variance in house prices.

Results and Impact:

The House Pricing Predictor effectively estimates house prices based on input features, providing a valuable tool for real estate professionals and potential buyers. The project showcases the practical application of linear regression and data cleaning techniques, resulting in a reliable pricing model that supports informed decision-making in the real estate market.
